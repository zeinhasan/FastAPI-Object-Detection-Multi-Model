## Supported Versions

Our commitment to maintaining a secure environment is paramount, and our security policy, particularly in the "Supported Versions" section, reflects this dedication. We prioritize the ongoing protection of our users by providing timely and effective security updates. In this section, we communicate transparently about the versions of our project currently supported with security updates. By doing so, we ensure that our users are well-informed about the software versions that receive the latest protective measures against potential vulnerabilities.
